# Browser Automation Rules

## Tool Tiers

| Tier | Tool | Use When |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | @playwright/mcp | Default for all browser interaction -- navigate, click, screenshot, snapshot |
| 1.5 | @playwright/cli | AI agent browser automation where token efficiency matters. Disk-based state. |
| 2 | CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`) | Performance metrics, network debugging, a11y audit, Lighthouse, console logs |
| 3 | Playwright-core (scripting) | Complex multi-step flows, custom logic, when MCP tools are insufficient |
| 4 | Playwright Test Runner (`npx playwright test`) | E2E test suites (`npx playwright test`), test recording (`npx playwright codegen`) |

## Tier 2 Quick Reference (CDP CLI)

Requires Chrome running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.

```bash
node scripts/cdp.mjs navigate <url>     # navigate + wait
node scripts/cdp.mjs perf               # TTFB, DOM, LCP, resources
node scripts/cdp.mjs network            # resource timing entries
node scripts/cdp.mjs a11y               # accessibility audit
node scripts/cdp.mjs console            # console messages
node scripts/cdp.mjs lighthouse <url>   # Lighthouse scores + Core Web Vitals
node scripts/cdp.mjs snapshot [-i]      # accessibility tree
node scripts/cdp.mjs screenshot [path]  # screenshot
node scripts/cdp.mjs eval <expr>        # evaluate JS
node scripts/cdp.mjs tabs              # list open tabs
```

All output is JSON. Replaces chrome-devtools-mcp (32x fewer tokens, 100% vs 72% reliability).

## Quick Start [H:8]

1. Use `browser_navigate` to open a URL
2. Use `browser_snapshot` to see the page (accessibility tree, not screenshot)
3. Use `browser_click` / `browser_fill` / `browser_select_option` for interaction
4. Use `browser_take_screenshot` for visual verification

## Deprecated Tools [C:10]
- `claude-in-chrome` (tabs_context_mcp, read_page, computer, form_input) -- DEPRECATED
- Do NOT use these for new browser tasks
- Legacy references in other files should be updated to @playwright/mcp

## Timing Rules [H:8]

| After | Wait | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| `browser_navigate` | Use `browser_wait_for` | Wait for network idle or specific element |
| SPA route change | Re-snapshot | `browser_snapshot` to get fresh accessibility tree |
| Form submission | 1-2s | Before verifying result |

## Error Recovery [H:9]

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| Element not found | Re-snapshot, find element in accessibility tree |
| Page not loaded | Check URL, retry navigate |
| Timeout | Increase wait, check if page requires auth |

## Anti-Patterns [C:10]
- NEVER use deprecated claude-in-chrome tools for new work
- NEVER take screenshots when `browser_snapshot` (accessibility tree) would suffice
- NEVER skip waits for dynamic content
