## Agents

Active agents are `.claude/agents/*.md` excluding `_archived/`. The `session-analyst.md` file remains at the repo root as a deprecated stub — its canonical copy lives at `_archived/2026-04-26-duplicates/session-analyst.md`. `braintrust-analyst` is the canonical retro-analysis agent.

## Hooks That Route Between Agents and Skills

| Hook | Event | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| explore-to-scout | PreToolUse(Task) | HARD BLOCK on subagent_type=Explore — forces scout |
| task-router | UserPromptSubmit | RECOMMEND agent based on keyword detection |
| guardrail-enforcer | UserPromptSubmit | SOFT BLOCK 1x/session — requires systematic-debugging / databases / code-review skills |
| skill-activation-prompt | UserPromptSubmit | RECOMMEND skill via skill-rules.json + LLM validation |
| maestro-detector | UserPromptSubmit | SUGGEST /maestro for multi-step prompts (R7 — re-entrancy guard added 2026-04-26) |
| react-perf-context | PostToolUse(Read) | INJECT — auto-loads react-perf skill on .tsx read |
| agent-model-guard | PreToolUse(Task) | HARD BLOCK on unknown `subagent_type` (agent file existence check; renamed from `agent-validate.ts` in R5, 2026-04-26 — name is historical, behavior is existence validation, not model gating) |
| no-haiku-enforcer | PreToolUse(Task) | HARD BLOCK on `model: haiku` (this is the actual haiku gate) |
| agent-verification | PostToolUse(Task) | VERIFY agent output quality |
| plan-exit-tracker | PostToolUse(ExitPlanMode) | WRITE state file on plan approval |
| plan-to-ralph-enforcer | PreToolUse(Edit/Write) | HARD BLOCK code edits when plan approved + Ralph not active |

### Routing Coverage Gaps

Agents reachable only by explicit name (no UserPromptSubmit hook routing):
- principal-reviewer (Phase 5c new — suggested addition: review workflow high-stakes path)
- wizard (Phase 5c new — entry is documentation-driven via BOOTSTRAP.md)
- agent-factory (Phase 5c new — invoked by user when scaffolding)
- validate-agent
- braintrust-analyst (companion skill exists; no UserPromptSubmit routing)
- memory-extractor
- pathfinder
- liaison (optional companion in release skill body only)
- judge (optional companion in refactor skill body only)

## Phase 5c Changes Reflected

This map was regenerated as Step 10 of Phase 5c. Changes since the Phase 5a map:

1. **Agents +3, deprecated 1**:
   - Added: `wizard.md`, `agent-factory.md`, `principal-reviewer.md` (R6, Option B — created rather than deleted)
   - Deprecated: `session-analyst.md` (canonical archived to `_archived/2026-04-26-duplicates/`; stub remains at root pending follow-up)
2. **Hook rename (R5)**: `agent-validate.ts` → `agent-model-guard.ts` (8 cross-refs updated, dist rebuilt, settings.json updated)
3. **R1 codified**: `sleuth` and `debug-agent` descriptions now point at each other for the inverse case; `fix/SKILL.md` has Investigator selection subsection
4. **R2 (judge/liaison discoverability)**: optional-companion callouts added to `refactor/SKILL.md` and `release/SKILL.md`
5. **R4 (sentinel ↔ browser-dev-cycle)**: bidirectional companion callouts confirmed
6. **R7 (maestro re-entrancy)**: `isMaestroActive()` guard added with 30-min mtime check; fail-open on read errors
7. **R8 (deployer ↔ neonctl)**: deployer.md has conditional Neon section + neonctl-safety reference
8. **R9 closed**: 4 memory sub-skills are distinct slash commands (recall-reasoning uses different backend)
9. **TLDR cleanup (Phase 5a addendum)**: `tldr-router`, `tldr-overview`, `tldr-deep` archived; `tldr-code` canonical; `tldr-stats` wired with `python3` → `python` fix

---

## Open Items

1. **session-analyst stub** still at `.claude/agents/session-analyst.md` despite canonical move to archive — delete or convert to one-line redirect.
2. **principal-reviewer hook routing**: not surfaced by any UserPromptSubmit hook; consider adding as conditional review-workflow step for high-stakes changes.
3. **Phase 4.2** (skill embed-router fallback) deferred — scheduled remote agent fires 2026-05-10 to revisit BGE-vs-TF-IDF decision.
4. **perplexity-search / firecrawl-scrape** — removed from oracle and primary pathways, but skill directories still exist; archive candidate.
5. **plan-agent path bug** — fixed at A1 to point at `plan-agent/SKILL.md` (was broken `create_plan/SKILL.md`).
6. **Documentation drift watch**: `help/SKILL.md` and `wiring/SKILL.md` still reference deleted hooks per Phase 1 gap log; out of scope for Phase 5c but tracked.
