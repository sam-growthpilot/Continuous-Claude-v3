## Blocking Hooks

Only PreToolUse hooks can block tool execution via `permissionDecision: "deny"`.

Key blockers:
- **file-claims** -- prevents concurrent edits to same file across sessions
- **ralph-delegation-enforcer** -- blocks direct code edits when Ralph is active
- **plan-to-ralph-enforcer** -- blocks code edits after plan approval
- **maestro-enforcer** -- blocks phase-skipping in Maestro workflows
- **no-haiku-enforcer** -- blocks haiku model selection for agents
- **test-before-done** -- blocks task completion without test evidence
