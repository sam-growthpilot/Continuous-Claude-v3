# Browser Dev Cycle: Five-Tier Automation Strategy

Comprehensive browser automation covering interaction, performance analysis, and scripted testing. Use the lightest tier that gets the job done.

## 1. Decision Tree

### Quick Selector

| Task | Tier | Tool |
|------|------|------|
| Navigate, click, fill forms, screenshot | Tier 1 | @playwright/mcp |
| Accessibility snapshot | Tier 1 | `browser_snapshot` |
| AI agent browser tasks (token-efficient) | Tier 1.5 | @playwright/cli |
| Disk-based YAML snapshots for agents | Tier 1.5 | @playwright/cli |
| Performance trace / profiling | Tier 2 | CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`) |
| Core Web Vitals | Tier 2 | CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`) |
| Network HAR detail / response bodies | Tier 2 | CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`) |
| Console errors with stack traces | Tier 2 | CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`) |
| CSS computed styles debugging | Tier 2 | CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`) |
| Network mocking / interception | Tier 3 | Playwright-core scripts |
| Viewport matrix testing | Tier 3 | Playwright-core scripts |
| Video / trace recording | Tier 3 | Playwright-core scripts |
| State save / restore | Tier 3 | Playwright-core scripts |
| Multi-page orchestration | Tier 3 | Playwright-core scripts |
| Visual regression | Tier 1 + Tier 3 | Screenshot compare |
| Write/run E2E test suites | Tier 4 | Playwright CLI (`npx playwright test`) |
| Record test from user actions | Tier 4 | Codegen (`npx playwright codegen`) |

### ASCII Decision Tree

```
What do you need?
|
+-- Basic interaction (nav, click, type, screenshot)
|   +-> Tier 1: @playwright/mcp
|       Direct MCP tool calls. No scripting needed.
|
+-- AI agent browser tasks (token-efficient, disk-based)
|   +-> Tier 1.5: @playwright/cli
|       Shell commands. YAML snapshots saved to disk. 4x fewer tokens than MCP.
|
+-- Performance profiling / network analysis
|   +-> Tier 2: CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`)
|       CPU traces, Core Web Vitals, response bodies, computed styles.
|
+-- Scripted tests / network mocking / recording
|   +-> Tier 3: Playwright-core CDP scripts
|       Full Playwright API via CDP connection. Write and run .mjs scripts.
|
+-- Formal test suites / codegen / cross-browser
|   +-> Tier 4: Playwright CLI
|       Full test runner, codegen, traces, reports. Write and run .spec.ts files.
|
+-- Multiple of the above
    +-> Combine tiers as needed
```

### Selection Rules

- **Start with Tier 1** for any interactive task — covers 80% of browser automation needs.
- **Use Tier 1.5** when an AI agent needs token-efficient browser automation with disk-based state (YAML snapshots, screenshots on disk — 4x fewer tokens than MCP).
- **Escalate to Tier 2** when you need performance metrics, network bodies, or computed CSS.
- **Escalate to Tier 3** when you need programmatic control (loops, conditionals, mocking, recording).
- **Escalate to Tier 4** when you need repeatable test suites, codegen recording, trace capture, or cross-browser testing.
- **Tier 1 + Tier 2** can run against the same browser instance simultaneously via separate CDP sessions.
- **Tier 3** scripts run as standalone Node.js processes and manage their own connections.

## 2. TIER 1: @playwright/mcp

Primary tool for browser interaction. Tools are called directly from Claude via MCP — no scripting needed.

**Setup** (add to `.mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

**Core workflow:**
```
1. browser_navigate  ->  Load the page
2. browser_snapshot  ->  Get accessibility tree with element refs
3. browser_click / browser_type / browser_select_option  ->  Interact using refs
4. browser_snapshot  ->  Re-read after DOM changes (refs are invalidated)
```

**Critical:** After any navigation or DOM change, call `browser_snapshot` again — prior refs are stale.

**Key tools:** `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_select_option`, `browser_press_key`, `browser_hover`, `browser_wait_for`, `browser_evaluate`, `browser_tab_new/select/close`, `browser_take_screenshot` (vision mode), `browser_handle_dialog`

Full tool reference with all parameters: `references/tier1-playwright-mcp.md`

## 2.5. TIER 1.5: @playwright/cli (AI Agent Browser CLI)

Token-efficient browser automation for AI coding agents. Saves state to disk (YAML snapshots, screenshots) instead of streaming into context — ~4x fewer tokens than MCP per task.

**Install:** `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest`

**Key difference from MCP:** State lives on disk, not in context. Agent reads snapshots selectively via `Read` tool.

**Core commands:**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `playwright-cli open [url]` | Open browser and navigate |
| `playwright-cli snapshot` | Save YAML accessibility snapshot to disk |
| `playwright-cli screenshot` | Save screenshot to disk |
| `playwright-cli click REF` | Click element by ref from snapshot |
| `playwright-cli fill REF TEXT` | Fill input field |
| `playwright-cli type TEXT` | Type text |
| `playwright-cli select REF VAL` | Select dropdown option |
| `playwright-cli eval EXPR` | Evaluate JavaScript |
| `playwright-cli close` | Close page |

**Workflow:**
```
1. playwright-cli open <url>          # Open browser
2. playwright-cli snapshot            # Save YAML to disk
3. Read the YAML file                 # Agent reads selectively (low tokens)
4. playwright-cli click <ref>         # Interact using refs from snapshot
5. playwright-cli snapshot            # Re-snapshot after DOM changes
```

**Options:** `--headed` (show browser), `--persistent` (save profile)

**When to use Tier 1.5 over Tier 1:**
- Agent-driven automation where token budget matters
- Long multi-step flows (token savings compound)
- When you need snapshots persisted to disk for later analysis
- Batch operations across multiple pages

**When to use Tier 1 (MCP) instead:**
- Interactive development (faster feedback loop)
- One-off inspections
- When you need the full 70+ MCP tool set (file upload, PDF, drag-drop)

## 3. TIER 2: CDP CLI (`scripts/cdp.mjs`)

For performance analysis, network debugging, and CSS inspection.

See [Tier 2 Reference](references/tier2-devtools.md) for full CDP CLI command reference.

Quick usage:
```
node scripts/cdp.mjs perf               # Performance metrics
node scripts/cdp.mjs network            # Network requests
node scripts/cdp.mjs a11y               # Accessibility audit
node scripts/cdp.mjs lighthouse <url>   # Lighthouse scores
```

---

## 4. TIER 3: Playwright-core CDP Scripting

For programmatic control — loops, mocking, recording, viewport matrix.

**Connect to Chrome:**
```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright-core';
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9222');
const context = browser.contexts()[0];
const page = context.pages()[0] || await context.newPage();
```

**Unique capabilities:** `page.route()` (network mock), `page.routeFromHAR()`, `context.tracing`, `page.setViewportSize()`, `context.storageState()`, `page.waitForFunction()`

**Pre-built scripts** in `scripts/`: `browser-setup.ps1`, `viewport-test.mjs`, `playwright-helper.mjs`, `network-mock.mjs`

Full patterns and code examples: `references/tier3-scripting.md`

---

## 5. TIER 4: Playwright CLI Testing

Full Playwright test runner for formal E2E test suites, interactive codegen, and trace debugging.

**Setup:** Already installed in continuous-claude (`npm install -D playwright @playwright/test && npx playwright install chromium`).

**Key commands:**
| Command | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run all tests |
| `npm run test:e2e:headed` | Watch tests run visually |
| `npm run test:e2e:debug` | Step through with inspector |
| `npm run test:e2e:codegen` | Record interactions interactively |
| `npm run test:e2e:report` | Open HTML test report |

**Full reference:** See `references/tier4-cli-testing.md` for codegen workflow, Ralph integration, and when to use CLI vs MCP.

## 6. Error Recovery

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Element not found" / "No element with ref" | Stale ref after DOM change | Call `browser_snapshot` again, find element with new ref |
| "Target page closed" | Navigation changed page | Reconnect; get a new page reference |
| "Navigation timeout" | Slow page or server down | Increase timeout; check server is running |
| "Connection refused" on CDP | Chrome not running with debug port | Launch Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` |
| "Protocol error" | CDP connection dropped | Reconnect to CDP endpoint |
| No MCP tools available | MCP server not started | Restart the Claude session |
| "Execution context destroyed" | SPA route change during evaluate | Get fresh page reference; re-snapshot |
| "Dialog is active" | Unhandled alert/confirm | Call `browser_handle_dialog` before other actions |

**Stale ref recovery (most common):**
```
Error: Element with ref "e5" not found
Recovery:
  1. browser_snapshot           -> get fresh accessibility tree
  2. Find the element again     -> it may have a new ref like "e17"
  3. browser_click ref="e17"    -> use the new ref
```

**Windows-specific:**
- Chrome profile lock: close other Chrome instances or use a different `--user-data-dir`
- Port 9222 in use: `taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe` (closes all Chrome)
- `cmd /c npx` fails: ensure npm is in PATH

**Retry strategy:** Re-snapshot and retry → wait 2s + retry → stop after 3rd failure and diagnose.

---

## 7. Workbook Platform Patterns

Workbook-specific SPA patterns (Next.js on Railway):

- **Sidebar nav:** click item → wait 1-2s → re-snapshot (SPA changes all refs)
- **Command palette:** `Control+k` → snapshot → type query → click result → re-snapshot
- **Data tables:** find header/pagination refs → click → wait 500ms → re-snapshot
- **Modals:** click trigger → wait 500ms → snapshot → fill form → click submit → verify closed

## 8. Workflow Recipes

Common multi-step workflows: Visual QA, API Debugging, Responsive Testing, Performance Profiling, State Management, End-to-End Feature Testing.

See: `references/workflow-recipes.md`

## 9. Deprecation Notes

| Deprecated Tool | Issue | Replacement |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| **agent-browser CLI (`ab`)** | Windows daemon startup broken (GitHub #89, #90) | Tier 1: @playwright/mcp |
| **Claude-in-Chrome MCP** | 6+ Windows 11 bugs. Extension approach is fragile. | Tier 1: @playwright/mcp |
| **Puppeteer MCP** | Deprecated upstream. ESM import errors. | Tier 1: @playwright/mcp |

The legacy `agent-browser` skill at `.claude/skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md` is preserved for historical reference only.
