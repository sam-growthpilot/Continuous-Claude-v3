## D. Platform API Details

### Claude Code API Requirements (programmatic use)

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

# Skills require these beta headers
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=[
        "code-execution-2025-08-25",
        "files-api-2025-04-14",
        "skills-2025-10-02"
    ],
    container={"skills": [{"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx"}]},
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Create budget template"}]
)
```

### File Download via Files API

```python
file_content = client.beta.files.download(file_id=response.file_id)

with open("output.xlsx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(file_content)
```

### Performance Expectations

| File type | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Simple files | 10-30 seconds |
| Complex files | 40-120 seconds |
| Large presentations/spreadsheets | 1-2 minutes |

### Claude.ai Upload Process

1. Navigate to Skills section in settings
2. Upload skill `.zip` or `.skill` file
3. Skill becomes available immediately
4. Test with conversational request

Skills activate based on conversation context. May need explicit mention initially: "Use my Excel template skill". After first use, activates automatically for similar requests.

## E. Troubleshooting Guide

### Scripts Not Executing

**Symptoms:** Script referenced in SKILL.md but doesn't run, error messages about missing files, or script runs with errors.

**Solutions:**
- Add dependency checks to script:
  ```python
  try:
      import openpyxl
  except ImportError:
      print("Install openpyxl: pip install openpyxl")
      exit(1)
  ```
- Verify all paths in SKILL.md match actual structure
- Use relative paths from skill root: `scripts/helper.py`
- Test scripts independently before packaging

### Skill Not Activating (Claude Code)

**Symptoms:** User query should trigger skill but doesn't.

**Solutions:**
- Update description with specific trigger keywords
- Test with exact phrases users will say
- Verify installation: `ls ~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name/`
- Restart Claude Code session after installing skill

### High Token Usage

**Symptoms:** Conversations use more tokens than expected, context fills quickly.

**Solutions:**
- Move detailed content to `references/` files
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines (~5k words)
- Eliminate duplication between SKILL.md and references
- Use scripts for code instead of including inline

### Common Issues Quick Reference

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Skill doesn't activate | Vague description | Add specific keywords and trigger patterns |
| Scripts fail to execute | Missing dependencies | Add dependency checks and error messages |
| High token usage | SKILL.md too long | Move content to `references/` |
| Resources not found | Wrong file paths | Verify paths match actual structure |
| Inconsistent outputs | Missing examples | Add more specific examples and edge cases |
