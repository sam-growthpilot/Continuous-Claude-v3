# Notion Claude Bridge Skill
## v1.5 | 2026-04-22 | Tracker auto-mirror

This skill governs all read/write operations on the Claude Bridge system — the shared knowledge and communication layer between Claude.ai (Eve), Claude.ai (Donna), and Claude Code. Always load `references/bridge-schema.md` before any write operation.

## Three-Instance Model

- **Eve (Claude.ai, personal):** Strategic layer — captures ideas, decisions, project direction. Buckets: Claude Bridge, X Research, Minions
- **Donna (Claude.ai, Fourth business):** Work strategic layer — Fourth AI projects, SPARK, RFP, Microsoft AI, competitive intel. Bucket: Fourth AI only
- **Claude Code (CLI):** Execution layer — reads context from HQ, builds accordingly, writes implementation notes back. Operates across all buckets
- **Separation:** Enforced by queue ownership, not page access. Eve never writes to Donna's queues; Donna never writes to Eve's queues.

---

## The Two-Layer System

### Layer 1: Claude Bridge Bucket (Action Layer)
Standard Notion Projects + Tasks, scoped to the Claude Bridge bucket.
- **Projects** = active inter-Claude initiatives
- **Tasks** = discrete handoffs, action items, things one Claude passes to the other

Follow all standard notion-task-manager API rules:
- Relations set in separate update call (never on creation)
- Priority: `High` / `Mid` / `Low` — never `Medium`
- Task title field: `Task` | Project title field: `Project`

### Layer 2: Claude Bridge HQ Page (Knowledge Layer)
Rich Notion page at the URL above. This is where context, decisions, and implementation notes live. Always reference `references/bridge-schema.md` for the exact section structure before writing.

---

## Handoff Format v2: Child Pages + HQ One-Liners

**This is the canonical handoff method. No exceptions.**

Every handoff is two things:

1. **A child Notion page** — the full handoff content as structured Markdown. Rich, complete, designed for easy human reading and AI parsing. Created as a child of Bridge HQ page (`30e76fd7-ac82-81e9-9fe1-c0b257088b34`).
2. **A one-liner entry in HQ** — status emoji + title + Notion link + one sentence summary. Nothing else in the HQ queue body.

### HQ One-Liner Format

```
[emoji] [HANDOFF] YYYY-MM-DD — [Title] → [Child Page Title](notion-url)
	From: [Source] | Priority: [High/Mid/Low] | [One sentence summary]
```

Example:
```
[HANDOFF] 2026-02-22 — /codex-review Skill Setup → [Eve→Code] /codex-review Setup — 2026-02-22](url)
	From: Eve | Priority: High | Install Codex CLI + create skill file
```

### Child Page Naming Convention

Child page titles always include queue direction:
- `[Eve→Code] Title — YYYY-MM-DD`
- `[Code→Eve] Title — YYYY-MM-DD`
- `[Donna→Code] Title — YYYY-MM-DD`
- `[Code→Donna] Title — YYYY-MM-DD`

This makes queue ownership unambiguous even though all child pages sit at the same HQ child level.

### Child Page Templates

Templates live at `references/handoff-templates/`:
- `eve-to-code.md` — Task brief (Eve passing work to Code)
- `donna-to-code.md` — Task brief (Donna passing work to Code)
- `code-to-eve.md` — Implementation summary (Code writing back to Eve)
- `code-to-donna.md` — Implementation summary (Code writing back to Donna)

### Status Sync Rule

**Both locations stay in sync.** The emoji on the HQ one-liner must match the Status field in the child page header. When status changes (Pending → In Progress → Done), update BOTH:
- The emoji prefix on the HQ one-liner
- The `**Status:**` field in the child page header block

### Status Values

| Queue Direction | Values |
|----------------|--------|
| Eve/Donna → Code | Pending, In Progress, Done |
| Code → Eve/Donna | Unread, Read (surfaced to Dave) |

---

## Core Workflows

### Eve Writing a Handoff to Claude Code
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page (read current state)
2. Identify appropriate section:
   - Tactical work item → Handoff Queue: Eve → Code
   - Strategic decision → Key Decisions Log
   - Context shift → Active Context
3a. notion-create-pages: Create child page under Bridge HQ with full handoff content (use eve-to-code template)
3b. notion-update-page: Insert HQ one-liner into Eve → Code queue section (insert_content_after targeting section blockquote)
4. Optionally: create a Task in Claude Bridge Bucket as action trigger
5. Report back to Dave with HQ page URL
```

### Donna Writing a Handoff to Claude Code
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page (read current state)
2. Identify appropriate section:
   - Tactical work item → Handoff Queue: Donna → Code
   - Business decision → Key Decisions Log
3a. notion-create-pages: Create child page under Bridge HQ with full handoff content (use donna-to-code template)
3b. notion-update-page: Insert HQ one-liner into Donna → Code queue section (insert_content_after targeting section blockquote)
4. Optionally: create a Task in Claude Bridge Bucket as action trigger
5. Report back to Dave with HQ page URL
```

### Claude Code Reading Handoffs
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page
2. Read: Active Context + Handoff Queue: Eve → Code + Handoff Queue: Donna → Code
3. For each pending item: notion-fetch the linked child page for full spec
4. Execute the work
5. Write back to the appropriate Code → [requester] queue (see below)
6. Add to Implementation Log after completion
7. Update Sprint State callout if status changed
```

### Claude Code Writing Back
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page (read current)
2. notion-create-pages: Create child page under Bridge HQ with implementation summary (use code-to-eve or code-to-donna template)
3b. Mirror to Weekly Work Tracker (auto-mirror): Before inserting the HQ one-liner, also create a Tracker row in the AI Enablement Weekly Work Tracker database. This feeds /weekly-report at report time. See "Auto-Mirror Protocol" below for field mapping + dedup rules.
4. notion-update-page: Insert HQ one-liner into appropriate Code → [requester] queue section
5. notion-update-page: Add entry to Implementation Log
6. Update Sprint State callout(s) if applicable
```

### Eve Reading Claude Code's Work
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page
2. Read: Handoff Queue: Code → Eve — check for one-liners
3. For each unread item: notion-fetch the linked child page for full details
4. Surface relevant items naturally in Dave conversation
5. Clear/archive queue items after surfacing (or mark as read)
```

### Donna Reading Claude Code's Work
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page
2. Read: Handoff Queue: Code → Donna — check for one-liners
3. For each unread item: notion-fetch the linked child page for full details
4. Surface relevant items naturally in Dave conversation
5. Clear/archive queue items after surfacing (or mark as read)
```

### Bridge Sync (Dave types "bridge sync")
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge HQ page (full read)
2. Audit all sections for staleness
3. Auto-sweep completed items:
   - Move DONE handoff queue one-liners → Archive subpage
   - Sweep Done sprint callouts + detail lines → Archive subpage
   - Archive uses reverse-chronological sprint blocks (narrative + Lessons field)
4. Update Active Context to reflect current reality
5. Update Sprint State (remove swept callouts)
6. Report summary to Dave: what's current, what's stale, what needs action
```

### Archive Lookup (looking for past work)
```
1. notion-fetch: Claude Bridge Archive page
2. Search for the relevant sprint block or handoff
3. Archive URL: https://www.notion.so/30e76fd7ac8281258cd9d281aa873298
```

## Auto-Mirror Protocol: Every Code→{Eve,Donna} Writeback Creates a Tracker Row

After every Code-direction writeback child page, create one row in the **AI Enablement Weekly Work Tracker** DB. The Tracker is the structured data layer `/weekly-report` pulls from; Bridge remains the narrative + communication layer.

### Field mapping (child page → Tracker row)

| Tracker property | Source in child page | Default if absent |
|---|---|---|
| Title | Child page title with `[Code→X]` prefix and `— YYYY-MM-DD` suffix stripped | — |
| Date | Today (UTC) | — |
| Type | Infer from child page Type field OR title keywords (fix→Fix, feat→Feature, rebuild→Fix, integrate→Integration, deploy→Deploy, else Ship) | `Ship` |
| Impact | Parse **Priority:** line (`High`→`High`, `Mid`→`Mid`, `Low`→`Low`) | `Mid` |
| Source | Always `Code` (these are Code writebacks) | `Code` |
| Dashboard Section | `Deep Dive` for project ships; `Integration` for MCP/plugin work; `Decision` if the child page is a decision log | `Deep Dive` |
| Project | Best-effort match against Projects DB by title keyword | Default "AI Enablement (generic)" row |
| Commits | Extract SHAs from `**Commits:**` field via regex `[0-9a-f]{7,40}`, comma-joined | `""` |
| Writeback URL | URL of the child page just created | — |
| Published in Report | `false` | `false` |

### Dedup guard (CRITICAL — prevents duplicate rows)

Before creating a Tracker row, query Tracker filtered on `Writeback URL == <child_page_url>`. If a row already exists, skip the create and log `SKIP_DUP` — this makes the auto-mirror idempotent. The server-side helper `find_existing_by_writeback_url` in `ai-reporting-mcp/collectors/tracker_collector.py` does this; from a Notion MCP session, query via `notion-query-database-view` or `notion-search` scoped to the Tracker data source with the Writeback URL as the filter value.

### Creating the row

Use `notion-create-pages`:
- `parent.type` = `data_source_id`
- `parent.data_source_id` = `6e8d9b17-f8ef-4d56-9f13-00344650ac03`
- `properties` map per the table above
- Relation format: `"Project": "[\"https://www.notion.so/<project-page-id>\"]"`
- Select format: plain string matching option name
- Checkbox: `"__NO__"` for false
- Date: expanded `"date:Date:start": "YYYY-MM-DD"`

### After row creation

Update the child page itself to add a `**Tracker-Row:**` field pointing to the new Tracker row URL. Use `notion-update-page` with `command: "update_content"` and insert the line after the existing header fields. This closes the traceability loop: from Bridge child page → Tracker row and back.

### When the user says "bridge sync"

Bridge sync currently sweeps completed Bridge queue items + sprint callouts to Archive. It does NOT touch Tracker rows. Tracker rows stay live until `/weekly-report` Phase 5 marks them `Published in Report`. Do not delete Tracker rows during bridge sync.

---

## Writing Rules for HQ Page

### Always:
- Fetch the page first before writing — never write blind
- Add new Decision Log entries at the **top** of the section (newest first)
- Add new Implementation Log entries at the **top** (newest first)
- Include date stamps on all log entries (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Keep HQ queue entries as one-liners only — full content goes in child pages

### Never:
- Overwrite the other Claude's entries without reason
- Delete Implementation Log history
- Edit Dave's manual additions without his instruction
- Write to Active Context without confirming it's actually still current
- Write long-form handoff content directly into HQ queue sections (use child pages)
- Eve: never write to Donna's queue sections
- Donna: never write to Eve's queue sections

### Section Update Triggers:
| Event | Section to Update |
|-------|-----------------|
| Dave makes architectural decision | Key Decisions Log |
| Eve passing work to Code | Handoff Queue: Eve → Code (child page + one-liner) |
| Donna passing work to Code | Handoff Queue: Donna → Code (child page + one-liner) |
| Code completing work for Eve | Handoff Queue: Code → Eve (child page + one-liner) + Implementation Log |
| Code completing work for Donna | Handoff Queue: Code → Donna (child page + one-liner) + Implementation Log |
| Any Code→{Eve,Donna} writeback | Tracker row via auto-mirror + child page `**Tracker-Row:**` field |
| Overall project focus shifts | Active Context |
| Sprint milestone hit | Current Sprint State |
| Bridge sync requested | Auto-sweep completed items to Archive, then audit all sections |
| Looking for past work | Fetch Archive page (not HQ) |

## HQ Page Section Reference

Load `references/bridge-schema.md` for the full section map with exact selection strings for `replace_content_range` and `insert_content_after` operations.

---

## Safety Rules

1. Always fetch HQ page before writing — read current state first
2. Never delete Implementation Log entries
3. Never create a new Life Bucket without Dave's explicit instruction
4. Always return the HQ page URL after any write operation
5. If HQ page content is ambiguous or conflicting — ask Dave before writing
6. Handoff Queue items should be cleared/marked after the receiving Claude has acted on them
7. When queues are empty, they show: `*Queue clear — no pending items. Completed handoffs in Claude Bridge Archive.*`
8. To add to an empty queue, use `insert_content_after` targeting the section blockquote intro line

---

## Claude Code-Specific API Notes

Claude Code uses the `claude.ai Notion` cloud MCP server (streamable-http). The rendering behavior differs from Claude.ai's native Notion integration. These rules apply ONLY to Claude Code sessions.

### 1. Selection Strings Must Avoid Link/Mention Syntax

`notion-fetch` renders page links as markdown: `[Page Title]({{url}})`. But Notion internally stores them as `<mention-page url="..."/>` XML tags. **Selection strings that include rendered link text will fail.**

| What you see in fetch output | What Notion stores internally |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `[Claude Bridge Archive]({{url}})` | `<mention-page url="..."/>` |
| `*Completed handoffs in [Archive](...).*` | `*Completed handoffs in <mention-page .../>.*` |

**Rule:** End selection strings BEFORE any link/mention text. Use the surrounding plain text instead.

```
WRONG: selection_with_ellipsis: "Queue clear...in Claude Bridge Archive.*"
RIGHT: selection_with_ellipsis: "Queue clear...no pending items.*"
   OR: Target the section header/blockquote instead
```

### 2. Prefer `insert_content_after` Over `replace_content_range`

When a section contains page mentions or links, `replace_content_range` selection strings are fragile. Use `insert_content_after` targeting the section header or blockquote intro instead.

| Scenario | Preferred Command | Target |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Add handoff one-liner | `insert_content_after` | Section blockquote intro line |
| Add log entry | `insert_content_after` | Section blockquote intro line |
| Update sprint callout | `replace_content_range` | Safe -- callouts have no mentions |
| Update Active Context | `replace_content_range` | Safe -- plain text section |

### 3. Sprint State Uses Callout Blocks, Not Tables

Tables are dead. Notion silently strips Markdown pipe tables and HTML table replacements are fragile. **Sprint State uses callout blocks instead.**

Each sprint item is a callout block + a plain text detail line:
```
::: callout
[emoji] **[Task name]** | Owner: [name] | Status: [status]
:::
[One line of supporting detail]
```

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use callout blocks for Sprint State — never tables, never Markdown pipes, never raw HTML
- Status emoji goes FIRST in the callout headline, before the task name
- Detail line sits OUTSIDE the callout as a plain text line immediately below
- To add a new sprint item: `insert_content_after` targeting the last detail line in the section
- To update status: `replace_content_range` targeting the callout headline (safe — no links/mentions in callouts)
- On `bridge sync`: sweep Done callouts + their detail lines to Archive

### 4. Handoff Queue Hygiene (v2 — Child Page Format)

Handoff queues in HQ contain **one-liners only**. Full content lives in child pages.

**Creating a handoff (two-step process):**
1. `notion-create-pages` — Create child page under Bridge HQ page ID (`30e76fd7-ac82-81e9-9fe1-c0b257088b34`) using appropriate template from `references/handoff-templates/`
2. `notion-update-page` — Insert one-liner into correct queue section via `insert_content_after` targeting the section blockquote intro

**Child page naming:** `[Queue] Title — YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `[Code->Donna] Bridge Format v2 Shipped — 2026-02-22`)

**Status sync:** Update emoji in BOTH the HQ one-liner AND the child page Status field when status changes.

**Don't delete completed entries** — leave them for the receiving Claude to sweep on `bridge sync`.

**Empty queue state:** `*Queue clear — no pending items. Completed handoffs in Claude Bridge Archive.*`

### 5. Practical Workflow for Claude Code

```
1. notion-fetch: Read HQ page (always first)
2. Identify target section from bridge-schema.md
3. For handoff queues:
   -> notion-create-pages: Create child page with full content (use template)
   -> notion-update-page: Insert one-liner via insert_content_after targeting blockquote
4. For sections WITHOUT links (Active Context, sprint callouts):
   -> replace_content_range is safe
5. After ANY write: verify by re-fetching if critical
```

### 6. Error Recovery

If a `notion-update-page` call fails with selection mismatch:
1. Re-fetch the page to see current rendered content
2. Shorten the selection string -- end BEFORE any `[link](url)` text
3. Switch to `insert_content_after` if `replace_content_range` keeps failing
4. Target a broader anchor (section header) rather than specific content
