name: health-check
description: Run a comprehensive CCv3 system health check that exercises real code paths across 13 categories (infrastructure, hooks, memory, skills, agents, RLM, CLI, tests, sync drift, external APIs, knowledge tree, git, roadmap). Use when users type /health-check, say "health check", "system check", "run diagnostics", "verify the system", or "is everything working", or when the user asks whether memory recall is functioning. This skill runs scripts/health_check.py and surfaces actionable findings with severity-ranked remediation steps. Scheduled weekly on Friday 8am as a recurring audit.

# Health Check

Run the CCv3 comprehensive health check. Behaviour-exercising, not existence-checking -- every check runs the actual code path a user depends on.

## What it covers

13 categories, ~35-50 checks:

| Category | Example checks |
|---|---|
| infrastructure | docker daemon, postgres container, env vars, opc/.env |
| hooks | dist freshness, settings.json registrations, node load test, vitest suite |
| memory | DB ping, end-to-end canary round-trip (store -> recall -> verify -> delete), growth rate, duplicates, stale entries |
| skills | frontmatter validation, description quality, broken references |
| agents | YAML parse, no-haiku rule, required fields |
| rlm | import smoke, pytest subset |
| cli | version checks for claude, docker, uv, gh, vercel, railway, neonctl, qlty, sentry-cli, linearis, tldr, etc. |
| tests | opc pytest smoke |
| sync | drift between continuous-claude/.claude and ~/.claude |
| external | Anthropic Developer API 1-token ping, claude CLI responsiveness |
| knowledge-tree | presence, freshness, valid JSON |
| git | uncommitted changes, remote sync |
| roadmap | ROADMAP.md present and non-empty |

## Headline check: memory canary round-trip

The single most load-bearing assertion. Stores a unique canary learning, re-recalls it, confirms it shows up as top result, checks the embedding is 1024-dim, deletes it, and re-verifies deletion. If recall is silently degraded, this is the check that catches it.

## Running it

Default (full run, ~2-3 minutes end to end):

```bash
cd $CLAUDE_OPC_DIR && PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/health_check.py
```

Fast subset (skip slow checks -- tests, vitest, canary round-trip, API pings):

```bash
cd $CLAUDE_OPC_DIR && PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/health_check.py --skip-slow
```

Scoped to a single category (great for iteration):

```bash
cd $CLAUDE_OPC_DIR && PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/health_check.py --categories memory
cd $CLAUDE_OPC_DIR && PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/health_check.py --categories hooks,agents
```

Quiet mode (suppress stdout -- artifacts still written):

```bash
cd $CLAUDE_OPC_DIR && PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/health_check.py --quiet
```

## Exit codes

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | all PASS |
| 1 | at least one WARN, nothing failed |
| 2 | any HIGH-severity FAIL |
| 3 | any CRITICAL FAIL |

## Output artifacts

All writes live under `.claude/cache/health-checks/`:

- `health_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` -- human-readable report
- `health_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` -- structured results
- `history.jsonl` -- one line per run for trend tracking

The Markdown report groups issues by severity, has a per-category pass/warn/fail table, and shows every individual check with its evidence string.

## Notion dashboard (weekly mirror)

Every scheduled run also mirrors results onto a Notion page so trends, WARN breakdown, and suggested actions live outside the repo where they can be reviewed casually and discussed.

- **Page:** [CCv3 Weekly Health Checks](https://www.notion.so/innovativemusings/CCv3-Weekly-Health-Checks-34c76fd7ac8280a984afc486a9844290) (id `34c76fd7-ac82-80a9-84af-c486a9844290`)
- **Sections auto-refreshed every run:** Current Status, Critical Path, Run Log (new row appended), WARN Breakdown, Your Suggested Actions
- **Sections preserved across runs:** Improvement Ideas (brainstorm), Automation (this section's doc)
- **Mechanism:** `scripts/scheduled-health-check.bat` pipes `scripts/notion-health-prompt.md` into `claude -p` after the Python run finishes. The prompt is deterministic: same page ID, same sections, same guardrails. If the Notion MCP is unavailable the step prints `notion-health-update: SKIP` and the scheduled task still reports correct exit status based on the Python run.
- **Fallback:** raw JSON/MD artifacts on disk are always authoritative. Notion is a projection, not the source of truth.

To test the Notion update manually without waiting for Friday:

```bash
type scripts\notion-health-prompt.md | claude -p --output-format text
```

(run from `C:\Users\david.hayes\continuous-claude`)

## When to run it

- Friday 8am scheduled audit (the primary use case)
- Before a major merge -- scope to the categories you touched
- When something feels off and you want an objective baseline
- Right after cross-machine sync or a fresh bootstrap

## When findings land

Work top-down by severity:

1. **CRITICAL** -- block everything, fix first (memory round-trip fail, docker down, hook load error)
2. **HIGH** -- current session should address (test failures, registered-but-missing hooks)
3. **MEDIUM** -- worth a ticket (agents missing fields, skill references broken)
4. **LOW** -- nice-to-have (CLI tools uninstalled, stale low-confidence entries)

Each FAIL/WARN carries a `remediation:` string with the exact next command.

## Examples

```
/health-check
```
-> full run, print summary, write artifacts.

```
/health-check memory
```
-> only memory category (connection, canary, growth, duplicates, staleness).

```
/health-check --skip-slow
```
-> infrastructure + static checks only, ~10 seconds.

## Implementation

See `opc/scripts/health_check.py` and `opc/tests/test_health_check.py`.
