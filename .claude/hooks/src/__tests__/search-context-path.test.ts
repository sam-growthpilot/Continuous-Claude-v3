/**
 * Tests for the search-context handshake directory resolution (QW-02 / D2b-05).
 *
 * The smart-search-router (writer) and tldr-read-enforcer (reader) share a
 * single CONTEXT_DIR handshake. It was a hardcoded POSIX literal
 * '/tmp/claude-search-context', which resolves to C:\tmp\ on Windows and
 * leaked per-session JSON files at the drive root with no cleanup.
 *
 * The fix relocates it under os.tmpdir() so behavior is preserved on POSIX
 * (os.tmpdir() === '/tmp') and fixed on Windows
 * (os.tmpdir() === C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp).
 *
 * These tests assert:
 *   (a) the resolved dir is under os.tmpdir()
 *   (b) it is NOT the old hardcoded literal '/tmp/claude-search-context'
 *   (c) both hooks resolve to the SAME dir (handshake intact)
