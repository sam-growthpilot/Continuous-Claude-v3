 * (B.3b) -- so the staleness / control-char / cap / sanitize logic has ONE
 * implementation and cannot drift between them. Pure + read-only; no I/O, never
 * throws on well-typed input.
 *
 * Cross-model hardening baked in from the B.3a review:
 *  - Codex#1: control chars (incl. NUL) are stripped + each term length-capped
 *    BEFORE it can reach a recall query argv (spawnSync --query) or an injection
 *    surface.
 *  - Codex#2: a missing/non-numeric turn_added is treated as STALE (a malformed
 *    bus must not bypass staleness filtering by omitting the field).
