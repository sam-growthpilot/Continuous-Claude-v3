# Self-Improvement Research Goal — {{DATE}} — Component: {{COMPONENT_NAME}}

You are a headless CCv3 research session. Your SINGLE goal today is to review one component of the
CCv3 agent harness, research how the field has evolved that capability, and write a concrete, cited
proposal for whether and how CCv3 should evolve it. This is one iteration of a recurring
self-improvement loop: the system studies its own components and proposes its next evolution. You
understand WHAT the system is meant to do and HOW we execute it via this harness — use that.

## Today's component
- ID: {{COMPONENT_ID}}
- Name: {{COMPONENT_NAME}}
- What it is: {{COMPONENT_SUMMARY}}
- Our current implementation (VERIFY against the repo — do not trust blindly): {{CURRENT_IMPL}}
- Frontier search hints (starting points, NOT limits): {{FRONTIER_HINTS}}

## Hard guardrails (unattended run — do not violate)
1. RESEARCH + PROPOSE ONLY. You may READ anything in the repo and research externally.
2. You may WRITE only within `docs/self-improvement/`: your proposal file (below) and, if needed,
   `docs/self-improvement/PENDING-DIGEST.md`. Do NOT edit, create, or delete ANY other file. Do NOT
   modify code, hooks, settings, skills, or the manifest. Do NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, or any
   state-changing / destructive command.
3. Cite every non-obvious claim (a URL, or a repo `file:line`). Unsourced claims are speculation —
   mark them `[Speculation]`. Avoid: best, optimal, always, never, guaranteed.
4. Stay bounded: ONE focused pass. Aim for 4-8 high-quality sources, not an exhaustive crawl. Be honest
   — "we are already strong here, SKIP" is a valid and valuable outcome.

## Method
1. BASELINE (what we have): Read the relevant slice of `docs/system-update/CURRENT-STATE.md` and
   `docs/architecture/INDEX.md`, plus the current-implementation pointers above. State concisely how
   CCv3 implements this component TODAY and its known limitations (the Fable-5 review already named many
   in CURRENT-STATE.md and `docs/system-update/BACKLOG.md`).
2. FRONTIER (what's new): Research the state of the art for this capability. PREFER delegating deep
   external research to the `oracle` agent (Task -> oracle); also use WebSearch/WebFetch and, where
   useful, nia / context7. Look for new techniques, papers, open-source frameworks, patterns other agent
   harnesses use, and what changed in the last ~6-12 months. Capture concrete, cited specifics.
3. GAP ANALYSIS: Compare us vs the frontier. Where are we ahead, even, or behind? What specifically
   could be better?
4. RECOMMENDATION: For each promising idea, give a verdict — ADOPT (do it), WATCH (track, not yet), or
   SKIP (not worth it / not for us) — with rationale.
5. INTEGRATION: For anything you would ADOPT, sketch HOW it integrates into CCv3 — which files/subsystems,
   how it ties to existing `docs/system-update/BACKLOG.md` arcs (reference item IDs like ST-01, ST-02,
   SG-04 where relevant), rough effort, risk, and what could go wrong.
6. BENEFITS: What does the user (the user) get — faster, more reliable, cheaper, more capable? Be specific.

## Before you write — citation self-audit (mandatory)

This is a single-pass run with no second reviewer, so YOU are the fact-checker. Before writing the
proposal, re-verify every external citation:
- For each arXiv ID / URL you intend to cite, confirm (WebFetch) the source EXISTS and actually states
  what you attribute to it. Post-cutoff arXiv IDs (2026+) are a real fabrication risk — verify directly.
- Do NOT attribute a specific named metric, term, or numeric figure to a paper unless that paper's
  abstract/page actually uses it. If you only have the concept, describe the concept and cite the paper
  for the concept — never invent a named metric and credit it to a source.
- Remove, soften, or re-source anything you cannot confirm. Mark anything you keep on weak evidence
  `[Speculation]`. A smaller, fully-verified proposal beats a larger one with one fabricated citation.

## Output — write EXACTLY this file: `docs/self-improvement/proposals/{{DATE}}-{{COMPONENT_ID}}.md`

Begin the file with this YAML frontmatter (fill the values), then the body:

```
---
date: {{DATE}}
component: {{COMPONENT_ID}}
component_name: {{COMPONENT_NAME}}
verdict: <adopt|watch|skip>      # the dominant recommendation for the component overall
headline: <one sentence: the single most important finding/recommendation>
sources: <number of distinct sources cited>
---
```

Then these sections:
- `# {{COMPONENT_NAME}} — Next-Evolution Proposal ({{DATE}})`
- `## 1. Where CCv3 is today` (cited to repo paths)
- `## 2. Frontier scan` (cited to URLs)
- `## 3. Gap analysis`
- `## 4. Recommendations` (each item tagged ADOPT / WATCH / SKIP with rationale)
- `## 5. Integration approach` (files, ties to BACKLOG ids, effort, risk)
- `## 6. Benefits`
- `## 7. Open questions`

## After writing the proposal
- Attempt a short digest to the Notion Bridge Code->Eve queue (use the `notion-bridge` skill / Notion MCP):
  date, component, verdict, headline, and the proposal path. This is BEST-EFFORT — if the Notion MCP is
  unavailable in this headless run, instead APPEND those lines to `docs/self-improvement/PENDING-DIGEST.md`
  (create it if missing) so the next interactive session can sweep it into the Bridge.
- Do nothing else. Do NOT commit or push. End the session.
