#!/bin/bash
# precommit-build-guard.sh
# Purpose: catch the "build-forget" deploy gap -- committing changed hook SOURCE
#          (.claude/hooks/src/**/*.ts) without the rebuilt dist (.claude/hooks/dist/*.mjs),
#          which leaves stale .mjs in ~/.claude/ after sync. See docs/ccv3-ws2-phaseB-plan.
#
# Contract (STATIC staleness check -- deliberately does NOT run `npm run build`):
#   `npm run build` HANGS in a git-hook shell on Windows (documented in .git/hooks/post-commit,
#   which is why post-commit passes --skip-build). A building guard would wedge every commit.
#   esbuild bundles shared/*.ts into the top-level entrypoints, so there is NO 1:1 src->dist map
#   -- hence the rule is "if any src .ts is staged, require >=1 dist .mjs ALSO staged", not per-file.
#
#   - staged .claude/hooks/src/**/*.ts (excluding __tests__/ and *.d.ts) AND no staged
#     .claude/hooks/dist/*.mjs                                              -> BLOCK (exit 1)
#   - same src staged WITH >=1 staged .claude/hooks/dist/*.mjs              -> ALLOW (exit 0)
#   - anything else (docs-only, dist-only, test-only, d.ts-only, nothing)  -> ALLOW (exit 0)
#
# Escape hatch:  SKIP_BUILD_GUARD=1 git commit ...   (or `git commit --no-verify`)
# Fail-open: any internal/git error -> ALLOW (never wedge a commit).
# No toolchain dependency: pure git plumbing + bash (works even if node/npm are absent).
#
# Known limitations (accepted -- inherent to the "no npm build in-hook" constraint):
#   - Coarse satisfaction: any staged dist .mjs satisfies the check; it does NOT verify the
#     staged .mjs actually corresponds to the staged .ts. Staging an unrelated dist tweak
#     alongside a fresh src change would pass. Closing this would need a build-stamp manifest
#     (a checksum of src/*.ts written by the build + verified here) -- out of scope here.
#   - Diff filter is ACMR: a pure DELETION of a src .ts is not guarded (deleting source does
#     not require a NEW dist; the stale .mjs is cleaned on the next real build). Type-changes
#     (T) are likewise out of scope.
#   - Newline-in-filename paths (legal but exotic) are not handled by the line-based match;
#     this codebase has none. Use `git diff -z` + NUL processing if that ever changes.

# Escape hatch -- explicit opt-out.
