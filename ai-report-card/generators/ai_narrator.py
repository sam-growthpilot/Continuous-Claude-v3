    return f"""You are writing a weekly AI Enablement status report for Carly Hodges, VP Enterprise Transformation & Technology at Fourth. The author is David Hayes, AI Enablement Lead.

CRITICAL: You are writing for a VP who does not know what a git commit, hook, or agent is. Translate ALL technical activity into business outcomes.

Use this vocabulary mapping:
- hooks = "automated safeguards" (quality checks that prevent errors)
- skills = "AI workflows" (reusable processes that save time)
- agents = "specialized assistants" (AI workers that handle specific tasks)
- commits = "capability iterations" (incremental improvements to the platform)
- connectors = "enterprise integrations" (connections to business tools like SharePoint, Teams)
- learnings = "organizational insights" (institutional knowledge preserved across sessions)

Generate the following sections in JSON format:

1. "executive_summary" - 2-3 sentences leading with BUSINESS OUTCOME, not activity. Example: "The AI platform now enables 3 teams to automate content workflows..." NOT "74 commits were made this week..."
2. "capabilities_shipped" - Array of 3-5 strings. Each describes a NEW thing the organization can now do, derived from this week's commit messages. Frame as outcomes: "Marketing team can now generate brand-consistent content automatically" not "Added marketing brain integration"
3. "business_impact" - Object with keys: "time_saved" (estimate based on automation delivered), "risk_reduction" (based on safeguards added), "adoption" (teams/users enabled)
4. "this_week_highlights" - 3-5 bullet points framed as outcomes. "Engineering team now has automated code quality checks" not "Added 5 new hooks"
5. "strategic_progress" - 1-2 sentences on how this week's work advances Q1 goals (platform maturity, team adoption, enterprise integration)
6. "per_project" - Object with project name keys, each containing a "delta" string (1-2 sentences framed as what the project NOW ENABLES, not what code changed)
7. "outlook" - 1-2 sentences on what's ahead next week, framed as upcoming capabilities

Keep tone professional but energetic. Show momentum through outcomes, not activity counts.
Do NOT make up metrics - use only the data provided below. But DO translate raw metrics into business language.

# This Week's Raw Data (for your analysis - do NOT echo these numbers directly)

## Platform Metrics
- Capability iterations this week: {totals.get('week_commits', 0)}
- Total capability iterations: {totals.get('total_commits', 0)}
- Files improved: {totals.get('files_changed', 0)}
- Active contributors: {totals.get('contributor_count', 0)}

## Platform Components
- Automated safeguards: {system.get('hooks', 0)}
- AI workflows: {system.get('skills', 0)}
- Specialized assistants: {system.get('agents', 0)}
- Enterprise integrations (live): {system.get('connectors_live', 0)}
