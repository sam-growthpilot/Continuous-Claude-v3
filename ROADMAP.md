# Project Roadmap

## Current Focus
**Notion Platform Integration + Living Project Cards** (branch `feature/notion-platform`)
- **Done (2026-07-03):** N0 spikes all PASS (`docs/notion-platform-spike-report.md`) — ntn 0.18.1 via winget, page access proven, HTML publishing path = create-attachment + `<embed>` (sandboxed, interactive, workspace-private), Markdown round-trip byte-identical, Projects-DB upsert loop working. N1 shipped: notion-cli skill + notion-cli-safety rule + CLI inventory (24 tools). Helm design package delivered earlier (3 styled drafts + landing artifact + session report). Plan premortemed twice (34 findings folded in, Codex cross-model lift both times).
- **Next:** A1 pilot card (CCv3 living status card replaces the S2 test embed) → N4r card engine (`scripts/project-cards/`, zero-LLM sweep assembler, `/project-card` skill) → N5 FourthOS rollout (cards on every active Projects-DB row + daily `CCv3-Project-Cards` sweep + Reporting Hub cards table) → N2 docs refresh (bridge-skill provenance merge v1.4/v1.5!) → N3 scheduled-job refits (dashboard-sync state machine, digest push).
- Helm local SPA deferred behind the daily-use gate; card engine is the Notion-first v0 surface.
- Plan: `~/.claude/plans/review-ccv3-system-wondrous-cascade.md` · Started: 2026-07-03

## Codex Integration — /codex worker (parallel track)
- **v0 SHIPPED (2026-07-07):** `/codex` write-capable Codex task worker (ask / implement / resume, on the ChatGPT subscription, no API key). PR #15 (`feature/codex-worker`), commit `12a21dd`. Built from an 8-agent research pass, dogfood-hardened, hooks-collision safety spike RESOLVED.
- **v1 SHIPPED (2026-07-07):** (A) session-id capture (`thread_id` → concurrency-safe `resume <id>`, live-verified vs `--last`); (B) startup latency via `--ignore-user-config` (~47s→18s, MCP-fails 6→2 — the planned `--profile-v2` overlay was empirically REFUTED); + telemetry one-row-per-turn/enum cleanups. Dogfood-hardened: a cross-model `codex-adversary` pass caught 2 real shell bugs (spaced-path/delimiter parsing + a `"last"` silent-failure), both fixed. Commit `832ce5a`. Evidence: `docs/codex-integration/DESIGN-RESEARCH.md` §11.
- **v2 SHIPPED to `feature/codex-worker-v2` (2026-07-07, 7 commits, ready for merge/PR):** approved **lean scope** built + dogfood-hardened. (1) `--complex` opt-in multi_agent (explorer.toml `gpt-5.5` pin gate, mode-scoped ask/implement; live probe: explorer spawned on gpt-5, ZERO gpt-4.1), (2) reactive usage-limit handling (preflight impossible — no quota surface; parser verified on the real error), (3) worktree GC (skip-dirty + exit-code-checked, no recursive delete, 7d default), (4) doc sweep. **Plus a CRITICAL v1 regression fix surfaced by dogfooding:** `--ignore-user-config` silently broke ALL `implement` writes on Windows (`config.toml` carries the sandbox write policy) → now `ask`-ONLY (confirming re-dogfood: implement writes again). Four review passes (Claude audit 8 + codex-adversary 4 + live probe + 2 dogfoods), every finding fixed + verified. Evidence: `DESIGN-RESEARCH.md` §12. v3 candidates deferred (spawn-detection telemetry, version-keyed `--complex` re-verify, burn-rate heuristic).

## Planned
- [ ] HELM — Local Project Command Center: Spec + Build Plan (high priority)
- [ ] Plan — Close out `snapshot/ccv3-system-update` + stage the fourthos v4 build (high priority)
- [ ] CCv3 System Update — execute the ratified deep-review backlog (Wave 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Deletions) (high priority)
- [ ] Agent + Skill Fleet Review — two-tier model map (Sonnet 5 / Opus 4.8-high; 12 Opus/25 Sonnet, `kraken`→Sonnet) + Pocock-aligned hygiene + Explore→scout fix (high priority) — plan: `~/.claude/plans/agent-skill-two-tier-model-policy`. Acceptance: R1-curate-decoupled-from-retier (DEL-11); explicit model on every surviving agent **`.md`+`.json`** (no omit/inherit/haiku, drift-checked; `.json` read at spawn by `claude_spawn.py`); `agent-factory` + `agent-model-selection.md` + `no-haiku.md` + CLAUDE.md agent-table/cost-routing rewritten; Explore→scout fixed (smart-search-router self-contradiction + `scout` route + `updatedInput` full-chain probe + regression test); Pocock 7-point pass per agent/skill (Trigger/Structure/Steering/Pruning); automated 4-surface drift test green; downgrade canary passed; Probe-Gate-verified (bare-alias + **effort** resolution, standing `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` guard, machine-wide `~/.claude` sync smoked in ≥1 other project)
- [ ] CCv3-Hardening — Session 9: through Phase C (codegraph) (high priority)
- [ ] P2 — Verify embedding daemon survives a REAL reboot (scheduled task only ad-hoc-verified; Codex flagged job-object detach). After next restart confirm `~/.claude/run/ccv3-embedding.json` appears <60s + warm recall (medium priority)
- [ ] P2 — Ops: full parallel `vitest run` hangs on a pre-existing Windows daemon/socket suite — add a hard per-test timeout (medium priority)
- [ ] P3 — Ops: async post-commit forward-sync race leaves active hook dist stale — hash-verify + `cp` after every hook commit until root-fixed (low priority)
- [ ] WS-2 Phase B activation: facade/enforcer shipped INERT — wire real routing-through-facade + enforcement teeth, then Phase C (codegraph) → D (memory bridge, needs GIN index) → E (observability) (medium priority)
- [ ] CCv3 Full Hardening & Improvement Program — make the system lean, correct, and *used-correctly* (high priority)
- [ ] WS-0 — Present-day bugs + live hazards: session-id consolidation (0.1, +`file_claims` migration), memory prompt-injection fix (0.2), structural sync-footgun fix (0.3 — delete `npm run build` from `sync-to-active.sh`), stale-Ralph `ccv3-visualization` deactivation (0.4), knowledge-tree regen (medium priority)
- [ ] WS-1 — Lean prune/consolidate: per-prompt hot-path (P1), memory reliability + agent-recall activation (P2), dedup/dead-code + Neon-token security (P3), enforcement-docs fix (medium priority)
- [ ] WS-2 — v3 Cohesive Intelligence substrate: Phase A foundations (context-bus) → B facade (`/code-intel` CLI) → C codegraph → D memory bridge (needs GIN index) → E observability (medium priority)
- [ ] Hygiene gate (early): verify `architecture-stats-sync` hook registered/built/synced; triage scratch files; push 5 commits to `fork` (medium priority)
- [ ] Scope decision (next session): full v3 arc vs Phase 0+A (recommended) vs Phase 0 only (medium priority)

## Notes
**CCv3 Hardening — durable pointers (preserved across planning per `bf91c19`):**
- Full handoff for the implementing session: `docs/ccv3-hardening-handoff-2026-05-30.md`
- Lean audit: `docs/ccv3-lean-audit-2026-05-30.md` · v3 design: `~/.claude/plans/we-have-recently-done-refactored-storm.md` · Codex raw: `.claude/cache/agents/codex-adversary/latest-output.md`
- **The 6 hard gates (do not violate):** G1 sync-fix-structural-before-WS2-hooks · G2 finish-UPS-prune-before-Phase-A · G3 injection-fix-before-agent-recall · G4 never-parallel-edit-the-same-memory-files (the May-2026 regression pattern) · G5 session-id-consolidation-needs-file_claims-migration · G6 skill-archive-cross-check-vs-Phase-B.5.
- Data note: use `count(*)` not `pg_stat` for usage calls (the latter mis-reported memory/PageIndex as empty). Live counts: archival_memory 569, pageindex_nodes 2418, file_claims 6720, sessions 1117.

## Recent Planning Sessions
### 2026-07-03: Notion Platform Integration + Helm Notion-First Pivot
**Key Decisions:**
- Helm pivots Notion-first: the approved Helm plan's **engine** (collectors, salience rules, brief pipeline + its premortem constraints) survives unchanged, but the v0 **presentation** layer becomes a Notion surface (Projects DB + views + HTML daily brief) synced via `ntn`. The local SPA (:3005, launchers, drawer, palette) is **deferred** behind the same daily-use gate — the graveyard lesson applied: ship the simplest surface tied to the key resource (Notion = Bridge/Eve/reports home).
- `ntn` surface: `login/logout` (keychain; `NOTION_API_TOKEN` env override; `NOTION_KEYRING=0` → file auth for headless), `api <path>` (httpie-style `=`/`:=`/`==`, `-X`, `--spec`, JSON stdout), `pages get/create/edit` (**Markdown I/O**; `--allow-deleting-content` gate), `datasources query/resolve`, `files`, `workers …` (deploy/exec/syncs/webhooks/env/oauth/runs), `doctor`, `--json/--plain/--yes` throughout. Windows Workers support added in 3.6.
- Live MCP server already exposes the new tools (`notion-create-view` incl. dashboard type, `notion-query-data-sources` SQL, `notion-update-view`, `notion-query-database-view`, `notion-query-meeting-notes`, `notion-duplicate-page`, `notion-move-pages`, `notion-update-data-source`, `notion-get-async-task`, `notion-create-attachment`).
- S1 CLI on Windows: `curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev | bash` under Git Bash → `ntn doctor`, `ntn login`, `ntn api v1/users` → 200. Headless: `NOTION_KEYRING=0` file auth works from a scheduled-task context. Never echo tokens.
- S2 HTML block write path: (decides brief publishing): hand-create an HTML block on a scratch page; inspect via `notion-fetch` and `ntn pages get` (round-trip shape); attempt creation via MCP `notion-update-page`/`notion-create-pages` with HTML content. Verdict: MCP-writable / Agent-only / not-yet → pick HTML-block vs Embed-fallback.

**Files:** docs/notion-platform-spike-report.md, .claude/skills/notion-cli/SKILL.md, .claude/rules/notion-cli-safety.md, .claude/rules/cli-integration-strategy.md, bash scripts/sync-to-active.sh, .claude/skills/notion-bridge/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/notion-bridge/notion-bridge/SKILL.md, references/bridge-schema.md

**Verification:** N0: spike report exists with 4 verdicts; `ntn api v1/users` 200 both interactive and headless-file-auth.

### 2026-07-01: Plan — Close out `snapshot/ccv3-system-update` + stage the fourthos v4 build
**Key Decisions:**
- Decisions (confirmed): stage v4 → build later; PR to main now but **keep** the branch.
- -title "feat(scheduled-tasks): self-improvement loop + 6 job fixes + Notion dashboard; stage fourthos v4" \
- -body "<summary of the ~8 commits since PR #11: SI-01 loop, judge/health/AIWeeklyReport/blocklist/fourthos-restore fixes, dashboard-sync, + the 3 fourthos v4 staging commits>"
- Merge the PR: into `fork/main` (`gh pr merge <n> --merge`, or the GitHub UI). Confirm the merge.
- Keep the branch: — do NOT delete `snapshot/ccv3-system-update` (per decision). After merge it can

### 2026-06-10: CCv3 Fable-5 Deep Review — "Hone to Elegance" (2026-06-10)
**Key Decisions:**
- User decisions (locked): (1) **merge PRs #8/#9/#10 first** — review one unified main; (2) **whole-system scope, recent-weighted** (extra depth on the 145 commits since the 2026-05-16 memory-upgrade era); (3) deliver **report + ratified backlog + quick-wins executed** this arc (structural refactors are a later ratified arc).
- Push **`fork`** (Rev4nchist), never `origin`. Never change BGE model/dim (`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`, 1024).
- The review is READ-ONLY: — no fixes during discovery/verification/synthesis. Fixes happen only in Phase 4 (quick wins) after ratification.
- Windows-safe commands (array-arg spawns, `Remove-Item -LiteralPath`, no brace expansion). **Never run the full parallel vitest suite** (known hang on a Windows daemon/socket suite) — no test execution during the review at all.
- Gates G4 (no parallel edits to memory files), G5 (WS-0.1 blocked), G6 (P3 archive cross-check) remain binding for the fix arc.

### 2026-06-06: CCv3-Hardening — Session 9 (reconciliation + P1 bus-bias)
**Key Decisions:**
- Step 0 repo reconciliation DONE: herd-fix PR #8 opened; 7 logical reconciliation commits on `chore/session9-reconciliation` (PR #9); 4 junk stderr-artifact files deleted; `.codex/` mirror + `tools/PerfView.exe` gitignored; leading-# memory-eval doc renamed + inbound ref fixed.
- P1 bus-bias hybrid-recall lift: **KEEP ENABLED** (user-ratified). Verified warm gate +7.3% top-score / flat 69% hit-rate (n=13, corpus 584); read-only PASS. The documented +33.6%/63->88% does NOT reproduce (stale snapshot; repr-only ~+14.5% matches the original +15.3%, diluted to +7.3% by the 5 STRONG cases). Deferred: tune focus-term weighting. Memory id 79da5d25.
- Two live-hazard findings flagged for follow-up (out of this push's scope): (a) a `store_learning.py` invocation with unquoted shell metacharacters creates junk files under `opc/` (one regenerated mid-session); (b) the `post-plan-roadmap` hook clobbered this Current Focus with a foreign project's goal (Salesforce/FastMCP plan `abstract-coral`) — the cross-project contamination guard did not catch it; this entry restores the correct session-9 record.
