# Project Roadmap

## Current Focus
**Steady-state maintenance** — reporting optimization track COMPLETE for local work (2026-07-17: 01–03 + 05 + 07 + 08 + 09 shipped; 04 first slice shipped, remainder = efficiency Phase 2 dedicated session; 06 awaiting Dave's IT ticket submission). Next up: verify first unattended fourthos-weekly run Thu 2026-07-23 07:00.
**Fable — close-out (CLOSED)**
- Fable build work is DONE and CLOSED (harvest + corpus + standing trap harness; PRs #20/#21/#22). **Verified 2026-07-16:** nothing Fable-derived is installed on ANY active behavioral surface — no rule, agent prompt, skill judgment text, hook, template, or `settings.json` registration (two independent greps: zero). The always-on `reasoning-discipline` rule was cancelled by the `no_lift` trap gate (Opus 4.8 scored 16/16 with and without it — it already saturates that judgment ceiling). Every Fable artifact is inert docs under `docs/fable-manual/`. **No hindrance to Opus agents; nothing to revert.**
- The only change that actually touched Opus was the separate model-tier retier (PR #17: explicit 12 Opus / 25 Sonnet, `kraken` → Sonnet) + one global `effortLevel: high` — a deliberate, reversible cost/judgment-density call, not a degradation.
- Two Fable follow-ups intentionally PARKED as backlog (below) — each gated behind the standing trap harness before any prompt-layer change ships, so a future Opus-hindrance can't land unmeasured.
- claude-for-sales SKO package parked until end of July (built + merged PR #25; remainder is human-gated).

## Fable Follow-ups — parked backlog (gated behind the trap harness)
Not started; the organized parking spot so they aren't lost. Both build on the Fable harvest and are gated by `docs/fable-manual/TRAP-TESTS.md` (arm B must beat arm A). Full detail: memory `fable-intelligence-and-agent-model-policy-followup`.
- **A — Targeted per-surface Fable injection.** Encode high-leverage Fable frameworks INTO specific agents/skills where a MEASURED gap justifies it (contract-writing → game-plan/workroom/worker agents; verify-by-re-derivation → critic/review-agent/principal-reviewer; risk = cost × lateness → premortem/aegis). NOT always-on — that debate is settled by the `no_lift` data. Depends on `docs/fable-manual/HIGH-LEVERAGE.md`.
- **B — Per-agent model + effort policy.** Agents carry explicit `model: opus|sonnet`, but effort is ONE global `settings.json effortLevel` applied uniformly. Want an agent → model → effort matrix (mechanical `spark` low-effort; deep `sleuth`/`principal-reviewer` high/xhigh). Scope: audit tiers, determine the Task-spawn mechanism (Workflow `agent({effort})` can tune per-call; Task-spawn can't natively), add a drift-guard. Anchors: `.claude/rules/agent-model-selection.md`, `check-agent-model-drift.mjs`.

## Codex Integration — /codex worker (parallel track)
- **v0 SHIPPED (2026-07-07):** `/codex` write-capable Codex task worker (ask / implement / resume, on the ChatGPT subscription, no API key). PR #15 (`feature/codex-worker`), commit `12a21dd`. Built from an 8-agent research pass, dogfood-hardened, hooks-collision safety spike RESOLVED.
- **v1 SHIPPED (2026-07-07):** (A) session-id capture (`thread_id` → concurrency-safe `resume <id>`, live-verified vs `--last`); (B) startup latency via `--ignore-user-config` (~47s→18s, MCP-fails 6→2 — the planned `--profile-v2` overlay was empirically REFUTED); + telemetry one-row-per-turn/enum cleanups. Dogfood-hardened: a cross-model `codex-adversary` pass caught 2 real shell bugs (spaced-path/delimiter parsing + a `"last"` silent-failure), both fixed. Commit `832ce5a`. Evidence: `docs/codex-integration/DESIGN-RESEARCH.md` §11.
- **v2 SHIPPED + MERGED to `main` (2026-07-07, PR #16, merge commit `2918259`):** approved **lean scope** built + dogfood-hardened. (1) `--complex` opt-in multi_agent (explorer.toml `gpt-5.5` pin gate, mode-scoped ask/implement; live probe: explorer spawned on gpt-5, ZERO gpt-4.1), (2) reactive usage-limit handling (preflight impossible — no quota surface; parser verified on the real error), (3) worktree GC (skip-dirty + exit-code-checked, no recursive delete, 7d default), (4) doc sweep. **Plus a CRITICAL v1 regression fix surfaced by dogfooding:** `--ignore-user-config` silently broke ALL `implement` writes on Windows (`config.toml` carries the sandbox write policy) → now `ask`-ONLY (confirming re-dogfood: implement writes again). Four review passes (Claude audit 8 + codex-adversary 4 + live probe + 2 dogfoods), every finding fixed + verified. Evidence: `DESIGN-RESEARCH.md` §12; CodeRabbit review addressed (PR #16). Enhancement candidates tracked in the v3 line below.
- **v3 BACKLOG (deferred 2026-07-07 — address later):** none blocking — all are premortem enhancement candidates: `subagents_spawned`/`subagent_models` telemetry (today's `multi_agent` field records fan-out ENABLED, not spawned), version+hash-keyed `--complex` re-verification (guards against a Codex CLI upgrade silently reintroducing the gpt-4.1 fallback), a local burn-rate heuristic before expensive implement/`--complex` runs, split-shell fail-loud for `--complex`, and a keep/resume GC sentinel. Full detail: `docs/codex-integration/DESIGN-RESEARCH.md` §12.

## Planned
*(curated 2026-07-17 — stale entries removed with evidence: Agent+Skill Fleet Review shipped as PR #17 `c2a9db2`; CCv3-Hardening through Phase C shipped — codegraph LIVE 2026-06-07 per `code-intel-boundaries.md`; WS-0/WS-1 + hardening waves shipped 2026-06-28/29 per `docs/system-update/BACKLOG.md` (Wave 0 + Wave 1 DONE); `snapshot/ccv3-system-update` close-out executed via the 2026-07-01 plan; early hygiene gate + scope decision long-since resolved.)*
- [ ] **Reporting optimization — remainder** (05/07/08/09 SHIPPED 2026-07-17: `62ff375` conventions, `b534dd5` health strip + trust metrics, `c38926b` /reporting ops verbs; statuses live in artifact `a45fad78`): **04 remainder** = reporting-efficiency Phase 2 (batched STDIN bind + meaning-based hash-gates — spec'd with premortem mitigations in `thoughts/shared/handoffs/reporting-efficiency/2026-07-17-phase1-shipped-phase2-next.md`; dedicated session; dashboard-sync deterministic repoint stays BLOCKED on GAP-1..4) · **06** unattended VP Weekly — IT ticket DRAFTED (`thoughts/shared/handoffs/reporting-optimization/it-ticket-batch-logon-draft.md`), Dave submits · manual follow-ups: live 7/02 hub-callout cleanup + reviewed-date stamps on human sections; ROADMAP-guard hook fix (H1/H2 file:line spec in the efficiency handoff) (high priority)
- [ ] Verify first unattended fourthos-weekly run — Thu 2026-07-23 07:00; check `~/.claude/logs/fourthos-weekly/` + verify-run.mjs classification (high priority, time-gated)
- [ ] fourthos v4 report enhancements — design-approved, staged on main via PR #12; dedicated session, resolve the 4 open choices first (memory: `fourthos-v4-build-queued`) (medium priority)
- [ ] HELM — Notion-first command center (pivoted 2026-07-03: engine unchanged, presentation = Notion Projects DB + HTML daily brief via `ntn`; local SPA deferred behind daily-use gate) (medium priority)
- [ ] Grok check-back — externally blocked (corp egress). When probe.ps1 shows READY: `/harness-update grok` (0.2.99 unverified) → grok-adversary pass on the parked plan. IT allowlist ticket for `*.x.ai` (medium priority, externally gated)
- [ ] Fleet-review residuals (post-PR #17): DEL-11 curation, Pocock 7-point deep-review pass, downgrade canary, `updatedInput` spike (low priority)

- [ ] WS-2 remainder: Phase B enforcement teeth (facade shipped inert; C codegraph is LIVE) → D memory bridge (needs GIN index) → E observability (medium priority)
- [ ] P2 — Verify embedding daemon survives a REAL reboot (scheduled task only ad-hoc-verified; Codex flagged job-object detach). After next restart confirm `~/.claude/run/ccv3-embedding.json` appears <60s + warm recall (medium priority)
- [ ] P2 — Ops: full parallel `vitest run` hangs on a pre-existing Windows daemon/socket suite — add a hard per-test timeout (medium priority)
- [ ] P3 — Ops: async post-commit forward-sync race leaves active hook dist stale — hash-verify + `cp` after every hook commit until root-fixed (low priority)

## Notes
**CCv3 Hardening — durable pointers (preserved across planning per `bf91c19`):**
- Full handoff for the implementing session: `docs/ccv3-hardening-handoff-2026-05-30.md`
- Lean audit: `docs/ccv3-lean-audit-2026-05-30.md` · v3 design: `~/.claude/plans/we-have-recently-done-refactored-storm.md` · Codex raw: `.claude/cache/agents/codex-adversary/latest-output.md`
- **The 6 hard gates (do not violate):** G1 sync-fix-structural-before-WS2-hooks · G2 finish-UPS-prune-before-Phase-A · G3 injection-fix-before-agent-recall · G4 never-parallel-edit-the-same-memory-files (the May-2026 regression pattern) · G5 session-id-consolidation-needs-file_claims-migration · G6 skill-archive-cross-check-vs-Phase-B.5.
- Data note: use `count(*)` not `pg_stat` for usage calls (the latter mis-reported memory/PageIndex as empty). Live counts: archival_memory 569, pageindex_nodes 2418, file_claims 6720, sessions 1117.

## Recent Planning Sessions
### 2026-07-15: /init-project Review + Hardening Plan
**Key Decisions:**
- Interview → CLAUDE.md: — auto-scan (package.json/README/configs/git), confirm with user, fill 8-section template from `references/claude-md-template.md`
- ROADMAP.md: — created with user's current focus
- Sentry: (conditional, deploy targets) → **7. E2E scaffold* → **8. dev-server scripts* (conditional web) → **9. summary**
- Hook table at bottom: all names verified real in dist except "memory-extraction" (actual family: `pre-compact-extract`, `session-end-extract`, `periodic-extract`)
- P1 — would cause a wrong outcome on the next run: *

**Implementation:**
- Normalize schema: in BOTH `continuous-claude/.claude/project-registry.json` and `~/.claude/project-registry.json` to the project-registry skill's schema: `name, path, stack[] (array), description, port, url, devCommand, status` (+ keep optional extras `github`, `deploy`, `kind`, `notes`, `sentryProject`, `linearTeam`). Convert the 7 string-stack entries to arrays; add missing `description` fields; make the two files byte-identical (repo ordering wins).
- Add `project-registry.json` to forward sync: edit `scripts/sync-to-active.sh` to copy `.claude/project-registry.json` → `~/.claude/`, and add a row to `rules/sync-known-gaps.md`.
- Rewrite init-project Phase 5: write the REPO copy (`~/continuous-claude/.claude/project-registry.json`) using the array schema, then run `bash ~/continuous-claude/scripts/sync-to-active.sh` (or copy both). Keep the port-conflict check, sourcing ports from the registry itself.
- `references/dev-server-pattern.md`: delete the static port list; replace with "derive used ports from `~/.claude/project-registry.json` at run time; assign next free 3xxx."
- `rules/dev-server-cleanup.md` + `rules/project-registry.md`: replace/trim their static tables the same way (keep 2–3 rows as *examples*, marked as examples, or point at the JSON). Prevents this class of rot permanently.

**Files:** references/claude-md-template.md, knowledge_tree.py, .serena/project.yml, .mcp.json, ~/.claude/project-registry.json, .claude/project-registry.json, references/dev-server-pattern.md, rules/dev-server-cleanup.md

**Verification:** `node -e` parse both registry copies → identical, all `stack` arrays, all have `description`.

### 2026-07-03: Notion Platform Integration + Helm Notion-First Pivot
**Key Decisions:**
- Helm pivots Notion-first: the approved Helm plan's **engine** (collectors, salience rules, brief pipeline + its premortem constraints) survives unchanged, but the v0 **presentation** layer becomes a Notion surface (Projects DB + views + HTML daily brief) synced via `ntn`. The local SPA (:3005, launchers, drawer, palette) is **deferred** behind the same daily-use gate — the graveyard lesson applied: ship the simplest surface tied to the key resource (Notion = Bridge/Eve/reports home).
- `ntn` surface: `login/logout` (keychain; `NOTION_API_TOKEN` env override; `NOTION_KEYRING=0` → file auth for headless), `api <path>` (httpie-style `=`/`:=`/`==`, `-X`, `--spec`, JSON stdout), `pages get/create/edit` (**Markdown I/O**; `--allow-deleting-content` gate), `datasources query/resolve`, `files`, `workers …` (deploy/exec/syncs/webhooks/env/oauth/runs), `doctor`, `--json/--plain/--yes` throughout. Windows Workers support added in 3.6.
- Live MCP server already exposes the new tools (`notion-create-view` incl. dashboard type, `notion-query-data-sources` SQL, `notion-update-view`, `notion-query-database-view`, `notion-query-meeting-notes`, `notion-duplicate-page`, `notion-move-pages`, `notion-update-data-source`, `notion-get-async-task`, `notion-create-attachment`).
- S1 CLI on Windows: `curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev | bash` under Git Bash → `ntn doctor`, `ntn login`, `ntn api v1/users` → 200. Headless: `NOTION_KEYRING=0` file auth works from a scheduled-task context. Never echo tokens.
- S2 HTML block write path: (decides brief publishing): hand-create an HTML block on a scratch page; inspect via `notion-fetch` and `ntn pages get` (round-trip shape); attempt creation via MCP `notion-update-page`/`notion-create-pages` with HTML content. Verdict: MCP-writable / Agent-only / not-yet → pick HTML-block vs Embed-fallback.

### 2026-07-01: Plan — Close out `snapshot/ccv3-system-update` + stage the fourthos v4 build
**Key Decisions:**
- Decisions (confirmed): stage v4 → build later; PR to main now but **keep** the branch.
- -title "feat(scheduled-tasks): self-improvement loop + 6 job fixes + Notion dashboard; stage fourthos v4" \
- -body "<summary of the ~8 commits since PR #11: SI-01 loop, judge/health/AIWeeklyReport/blocklist/fourthos-restore fixes, dashboard-sync, + the 3 fourthos v4 staging commits>"
- Merge the PR: into `fork/main` (`gh pr merge <n> --merge`, or the GitHub UI). Confirm the merge.
- Keep the branch: — do NOT delete `snapshot/ccv3-system-update` (per decision). After merge it can

### 2026-06-10: CCv3 Fable-5 Deep Review — "Hone to Elegance" (2026-06-10)
**Key Decisions:**
- User decisions (locked): (1) **merge PRs #8/#9/#10 first** — review one unified main; (2) **whole-system scope, recent-weighted** (extra depth on the 145 commits since the 2026-05-16 memory-upgrade era); (3) deliver **report + ratified backlog + quick-wins executed** this arc (structural refactors are a later ratified arc).
- Push **`fork`** (Rev4nchist), never `origin`. Never change BGE model/dim (`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`, 1024).
- The review is READ-ONLY: — no fixes during discovery/verification/synthesis. Fixes happen only in Phase 4 (quick wins) after ratification.
- Windows-safe commands (array-arg spawns, `Remove-Item -LiteralPath`, no brace expansion). **Never run the full parallel vitest suite** (known hang on a Windows daemon/socket suite) — no test execution during the review at all.
- Gates G4 (no parallel edits to memory files), G5 (WS-0.1 blocked), G6 (P3 archive cross-check) remain binding for the fix arc.

### 2026-06-06: CCv3-Hardening — Session 9 (reconciliation + P1 bus-bias)
**Key Decisions:**
- Step 0 repo reconciliation DONE: herd-fix PR #8 opened; 7 logical reconciliation commits on `chore/session9-reconciliation` (PR #9); 4 junk stderr-artifact files deleted; `.codex/` mirror + `tools/PerfView.exe` gitignored; leading-# memory-eval doc renamed + inbound ref fixed.
- P1 bus-bias hybrid-recall lift: **KEEP ENABLED** (user-ratified). Verified warm gate +7.3% top-score / flat 69% hit-rate (n=13, corpus 584); read-only PASS. The documented +33.6%/63->88% does NOT reproduce (stale snapshot; repr-only ~+14.5% matches the original +15.3%, diluted to +7.3% by the 5 STRONG cases). Deferred: tune focus-term weighting. Memory id 79da5d25.
- Two live-hazard findings flagged for follow-up (out of this push's scope): (a) a `store_learning.py` invocation with unquoted shell metacharacters creates junk files under `opc/` (one regenerated mid-session); (b) the `post-plan-roadmap` hook clobbered this Current Focus with a foreign project's goal (Salesforce/FastMCP plan `abstract-coral`) — the cross-project contamination guard did not catch it; this entry restores the correct session-9 record.
