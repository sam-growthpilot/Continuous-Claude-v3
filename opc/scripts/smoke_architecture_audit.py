AUDIT_QUESTION = """You are auditing the Continuous Claude (CCv3) architecture. The corpus contains every operational rule, every skill SKILL.md, every agent definition, every hook TypeScript source file, the core Python memory/ralph/knowledge-tree scripts, the architecture docs, CLAUDE.md, RULES.md, and ROADMAP.md. Treat the banner path of each file as its identity.

Produce a structured audit report with these 10 sections. Cite filenames for every finding. Be exhaustive and specific. No vague claims.

## 1. COVERAGE MAP
Count by category:
- Total operational rules (.claude/rules/*.md)
- Total skills (SKILL.md files)
- Total agents (.claude/agents/*.md)
- Total hooks (hooks/src/*.ts)
- Total core Python scripts

## 2. OVERLAP / REDUNDANCY
Identify skills or rules that cover the same territory. List at least 8 specific overlaps by name, with shared territory described.

## 3. TRIGGER RELIABILITY (skills)
Scan skill descriptions. Flag:
- Under 30 words
- No explicit "use when" / "when users request" phrase
- Vague single-keyword triggers
- References to nonexistent files/skills
List at least 6 specific skills with the specific issue.

## 4. RULE CONFLICTS / TENSIONS
Rule pairs that could contradict under some condition. Name the pair, quote the tension, describe when it fires. At least 4 pairs.

## 5. HOOK RELIABILITY SURVEY
From the TS source in hooks/src/*.ts, list hooks with:
- Missing try/catch around main logic
- Edit tool used on settings.json (violates windows-platform.md)
- Long spawnSync operations risking SessionEnd timeout
- Crashes on missing env vars
- Unicode/emoji in stdout (Windows cp1252 breakage)
- No test file in src/__tests__/
At least 5 concrete findings with filenames.

## 6. STALE / BROKEN REFERENCES
- Files referencing claude-in-chrome (deprecated)
- References to nonexistent files/skills/agents/hooks
- CLI tools referenced but not in cli-integration-strategy.md inventory
- TODO / FIXME / deprecated markers
At least 6 concrete findings.

## 7. MISSING GUARDRAILS
Dangerous operations with no safety rule:
- CLI tools without a *-safety.md rule
- Hooks that mutate state without audit logging
- Python scripts that write files without dry-run option
- Skills/agents doing destructive operations without confirmation gates
At least 3 gaps with specific recommendations.

## 8. STRUCTURAL DRIFT
- ROADMAP.md goals vs shipped state
- Docs describing rules/skills/agents that no longer exist
- Rules referencing renamed/removed hooks
- Memory patterns documented but not implemented
At least 3 concrete drift points.

## 9. TOP 10 CONCRETE TIGHTENING RECOMMENDATIONS
Rank by impact (highest first). Each: specific (file/component names), actionable (what change), justified (which finding motivates it).

## 10. SYSTEM HEALTH VERDICT
One paragraph, 80 words max. Healthy / partially healthy / unhealthy? Biggest single risk. Biggest single strength.

Be exhaustive. Cite filenames. Enumerate, do not summarize."""
