"""Tests for Phase 4C: dedup is now scoped by project_id, not session_id.

Prior to Phase 4C, the dedup query in store_learning_v2 called
``memory.search_vector(embedding, limit=1)`` -- which filters by
``session_id = self.session_id``. So identical content stored from session
A and session B would BOTH land in archival_memory because the dedup search
only looked at session A's rows from session A's perspective.

Phase 4C adds ``MemoryServicePG.search_vector_for_dedup`` which scopes by
project_id (PROJECT scope) or by GLOBAL scope (no project filter), and
``store_learning_v2`` now calls that method. Threshold stays at 0.85.

Two layers of tests:
  1. Unit-level: stub out search_vector_for_dedup and confirm it's called
     with the right (scope, project_id) tuple.
  2. Integration-level (DATABASE_URL required): store identical content
     across sessions/projects and confirm row count deltas.
